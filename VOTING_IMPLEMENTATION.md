# Voting Feature Implementation - Complete

## âœ… What Was Built

### 1. **Vote Model** (`website/models.py`)
- New `Vote` table to track user votes
- Fields: user_id, contest_date, vote_time, first/second/third_place_submission_id
- Relationships to User and Submission models
- Added default values to Submission vote counters and scores

### 2. **Voting Blueprint** (`website/voting.py`)
- New route `/voting` with GET and POST handlers
- **GET:** Displays all submissions from today (or recent if none today)
- **POST:** Processes vote submission with comprehensive validation:
  - âœ… Ensures all 3 places are selected
  - âœ… Prevents duplicate voting (one vote per user per day)
  - âœ… Prevents selecting same submission multiple times
  - âœ… Prevents voting for your own submission
  - âœ… Updates vote counts on submissions (first/second/third place)
  - âœ… Calculates and adds scores (3/2/1 points)

### 3. **Voting UI** (`website/templates/voting.html`)
- Complete redesign from placeholder content
- Displays all submissions with images
- Radio button form for 1st/2nd/3rd place selection
- Shows current scores for each submission
- Helpful messages:
  - "You have already voted today" if user voted
  - "No submissions available" if none exist
- Clean card-based layout with submission images

### 4. **Enhanced Profile Page** (`website/templates/profile.html`)
- Shows user account info and member since date
- Displays contest wins (1st/2nd/3rd place counts)
- Lists all user submissions with:
  - Image preview
  - Submission name and prompt
  - Total score and vote breakdown
  - Individual vote counts per place

### 5. **Dynamic Home Page** (`website/templates/home.html` + `website/views.py`)
- Shows top 3 submissions (winners) based on scores
- Displays actual submission images instead of placeholders
- Shows scores and artist info
- Falls back to "No winners yet" message if no submissions

### 6. **Database Integration**
- Registered Vote model in `website/__init__.py`
- Added relationships between User, Submission, and Vote
- Automatic database table creation on first run

## ðŸ“‚ Files Modified/Created

**Created:**
- `website/voting.py` - New voting blueprint
- `VOTING_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Complete testing instructions

**Modified:**
- `website/models.py` - Added Vote model
- `website/__init__.py` - Registered voting blueprint and Vote model
- `website/views.py` - Added top submissions logic for home page
- `website/templates/voting.html` - Complete voting UI

## ðŸ§ª Testing Status

The application is **running locally** at http://localhost:5000

**To test the complete flow:**

1. âœ… Create 2+ accounts (signup/login works)
2. âœ… Upload submissions via `/contest` (works with validation)
3. âœ… Vote via `/voting` (complete with all validations)
4. âœ… View results on home page (shows top submissions)
5. âœ… Check profile page (shows user submissions and stats)

See `VOTING_TEST_GUIDE.md` for detailed testing instructions.

## ðŸ”„ What's Next

For your midpoint demo and report:

### Immediate (for demo):
1. Create test data (2-3 accounts, multiple submissions, some votes)
2. Take screenshots of each page showing functionality
3. Record demo video showing the complete flow
4. Export SQLite database view showing Vote and Submission tables

### Before Cloud Deployment:
1. Add username field usage (currently only email is used)
2. Implement daily contest reset mechanism
3. Add winner calculation and announcement
4. Move from SQLite to Cloud SQL
5. Store images in Cloud Storage
6. Add Cloud Scheduler for daily automation

## ðŸ’¡ Current Limitations & Future Improvements

**Current Design (for demo):**
- Date-based filtering uses UTC dates
- Prompt is hardcoded as "Alien Invasion"
- Scores are cumulative (don't reset daily yet)
- No admin interface for contest management

**Planned Improvements:**
- Dynamic prompt management
- Automated daily winner announcement
- Email notifications
- User leaderboards
- Contest history archive
- Image moderation/validation
- Mobile-responsive improvements
